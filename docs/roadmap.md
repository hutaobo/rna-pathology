# RNA-Pathology Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of RNA-Pathology as a
schema-driven database framework.

---

## Phase 0: Architecture and Documentation (Current)

- Define and refine conceptual schema
- Establish documentation structure
- Clarify scope and guiding principles

---

## Phase 1: Pilot Datasets

- Integrate a limited number of pilot datasets
- Validate schema applicability across technologies
- Refine documentation based on real data usage

---

## Phase 2: Programmatic Access and Scaling

- Introduce structured data access mechanisms
- Develop programmatic interfaces (APIs)
- Support larger-scale and multi-modal datasets

---

The roadmap is intentionally conservative, prioritizing stability,
clarity, and reproducibility over rapid expansion.
