# About

RNA Pathology is developed at the intersection of
spatial transcriptomics, pathology, and computational biology.

The project is motivated by the need for infrastructure
that treats tissue architecture and pathology as first-class
biological variables in RNA-based analysis.

The database is developed at SciLifeLab, Sweden,
with a focus on both methodological innovation
and translational relevance.
