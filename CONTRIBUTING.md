# Contributing to RNA-Pathology

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **RNA-Pathology**.

RNA-Pathology is an open research initiative aimed at building a
schema-driven database framework for spatial molecular pathology data.
Contributions are welcome at multiple levels, including conceptual
feedback, documentation improvements, and (in later phases) data
contributions.

This document outlines how to get involved.

## Scope of Contributions

At the current stage, RNA-Pathology primarily welcomes contributions in
the following areas:

### 1. Conceptual Feedback
- Comments on the overall database design and scope
- Suggestions for schema organization and terminology
- Discussion of use cases in spatial pathology and spatial omics

### 2. Documentation
- Improvements to existing documentation
- Clarifications of schema concepts
- Examples and best practices
- Typo fixes and structural improvements

### 3. Schema Development
- Proposals for extending or refining schema layers
- Suggestions for new data layers or derived representations
- Versioned schema discussions (e.g. v0.2 → v0.3)

### 4. Pilot Datasets (Limited)
- At this stage, data contributions are limited to invited or pilot
  datasets
- Public calls for broader data submissions will be announced in
  future phases

## What RNA-Pathology Is (and Is Not)

To ensure alignment, please note:

**RNA-Pathology is:**
- A schema-first, research-oriented database framework
- Focused on spatial molecular pathology
- Designed for reproducibility and long-term extensibility

**RNA-Pathology is not:**
- A general-purpose data hosting platform
- A visualization-first web portal
- A closed or proprietary system

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues or Suggestions

If you encounter an issue or would like to propose an idea:

1. Open a GitHub Issue
2. Clearly describe the problem, suggestion, or question
3. Provide context, examples, or references when possible

Conceptual discussions are welcome and encouraged.

---

### Contributing Documentation

Documentation lives primarily in the `docs/` directory.

To contribute documentation changes:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make clear, well-scoped edits
4. Submit a pull request with a concise description

Please aim for clarity and precision over verbosity.

---

### Proposing Schema Changes

Schema changes should be proposed deliberately and transparently.

When proposing a schema change:

- Clearly state the motivation
- Describe how the change fits into existing layers
- Consider backward compatibility
- Reference relevant standards or prior work where applicable

Substantial schema changes should be discussed via GitHub Issues before
opening a pull request.

---

## Data Contributions

At present, RNA-Pathology does **not** accept unrestricted data uploads.

Planned future support includes:
- Public datasets
- Controlled-access datasets
- Programmatic data ingestion

Until then, data contributions are handled on a case-by-case basis.
If you believe your dataset is a good fit, please open an issue to
initiate a discussion.

---

## Coding Standards (When Applicable)

As infrastructure code is introduced:

- Keep implementations modular and well-documented
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Avoid hard-coding assumptions about specific technologies
- Ensure reproducibility and transparency

Specific coding guidelines will be added as the codebase evolves.

## Licensing and Attribution

By contributing to RNA-Pathology, you agree that your contributions will
be released under the repository’s license.

If your contribution builds upon prior work, datasets, or publications,
please ensure appropriate attribution and licensing compatibility.

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to interact respectfully and
constructively.

Harassment, discrimination, or unprofessional behavior will not be
tolerated.

---

## Contact

For questions, suggestions, or discussions not suited for public issues,
please use the GitHub repository as the primary point of contact.
